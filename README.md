# HTML-CSS

HTML is a language used to structure web pages. It uses tags, which are enclosed in less-than and greater-than symbols, to mark different elements. Tags come in two types: opening tags and closing tags. The opening tag for a paragraph is <p>, and the closing tag is </p> There different tags for different elements.

tags for Headlines: <h> </h>
tags to emphasize: <em> </em>

there are elements to make text bold or Italic those tags are:
bold: <b> </b>
Italic:<i> </i>

we can also use element<strong> </strong> to highlight the importance of a word.

HTML also consist of lists which may differ with elements according to which list they are.
we will cover 3 different types of lists which are:

Unordered lists
Each item in the list is enclosed in an <li> element, which represents a list item. When you view it in the browser, notice that a dot or marker appears before each item. To define the entire list and specify its type, we wrap all the items in a <ul> element, which stands for an unordered list.

Ordered Lists
Ordered list which is similar to the unordered list but with a slight difference. Instead of using <ul> to wrap the list items, we use <ol>. The term "ol" stands for ordered list, indicating that there is a specific order to the items on the list.

definition lists
Unlike unordered or ordered lists with their list items, the definition list is used when we want to create a list that resembles a key-value pair in computer science. Instead of just items, we have terms and their corresponding descriptions.

To create a definition list, we use specific elements. The term or key is enclosed in a  tag, which stands for definition term. The description or value is enclosed in a  tag, which stands for definition description. You can have multiple descriptions for each term by using multiple  tags. The entire list is wrapped in a  tag, representing the definition list. Interestingly, the  tags and  tags are placed side by side without any additional wrapper around them. 

HTML date and time:
we use the <time> element. It consists of an opening tag (<time>) and a closing tag (</time>).

br and pre elements(to add space)
 br and pre elements. Usually, when we write code, we can add as many spaces and line breaks as we want, and the browser will ignore them. 

 HTML supercript, Subscript and small text
